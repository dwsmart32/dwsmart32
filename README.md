# Dongwook, Lee 🌏
Hey! 👋  I’m a fourth year undergraduate student at Seoul National University studying computer science.
I’m particularly interested in reinforcement learning and guiding 🤖 agents to survive in uncertain environments.
Plus, I’m also very interested in multi-domain topics, especially in the fields of image🖼️ and text📖 processing.
